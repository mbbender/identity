#Why now?

I came across Jekyll, what feels like 6 years ago when I was first looking
for a why to sort of meta program light-weight e-commerce sites. As I and
the project have matured I decided last night around 3:30am that it was time
to give it a second look.

Turns out my last blog post was March 12th, 2013. I suppose the clunky wordpress
installation I had was not cutting the mustard. What a great way to dog food (Am I using
this term right? I keep hearing it so thought I'd try it out.) Jekyll.

Hopefully this tool will help me post more often and ultimately becomes a
business tool I can use over at [SociableShops](http://sociableshops.com).
